# EntityResolutionWithPyG
EmbDI is a framework that uses a graph as an intermediate representation for relational tables to generate embeddings of schema
elements such as tuples, tokens, and columns. It was proved this
approach causes a lower loss of information if compared to frameworks that
consider tuples as sentences.
In my project, I re-implemented from scratch EmbDI using PyTorch geo-
metric to generate the embeddings. My objective was to test the performances
of this deep learning library based on Graph Neural Networks on the entity
resolution task.
